Today on the ward, I was tasked with assisting Mr. E, a 78-year-old gentleman, with his morning wash. He is mobile but a little unsteady on his feet following a recent chest infection.

Before I started, I made sure to gather all the equipment I would need: a bowl of warm water, soap, towels, and a clean gown. I introduced myself to Mr. E and clearly explained that I was there to help him with his wash, and I asked if that was okay with him. He consented, so I pulled the curtains fully around his bed to ensure his privacy.

During the wash, I spoke with him and made sure he was comfortable. I noticed a small, dry patch of skin on his elbow and made a mental note to document it and inform the qualified nurse in charge. I followed the procedure we were taught for assisting a patient, ensuring he could do as much as possible for himself to maintain his independence.

After he was comfortable in his clean gown, I cleared away the equipment, disposed of the water correctly, and ensured his call bell was within reach. I then reported the dry skin patch to the staff nurse.

I feel this experience helped me practice the basic steps of providing personal care while respecting a patient's dignity and privacy.
