I had another awful shift today. I was with a patient who was at the end of their life, and the family was there. I tried to do everything right, but I feel like I just made things worse. I couldn't find the words to comfort them, and I think I just stood there awkwardly.

After they left, my mentor told me I need to be more resilient. I know she's right, but I don't think I can do this anymore. Every day I come home feeling like a complete failure. I'm letting everyone down - the patients, my colleagues, my family. The weight of it all is just crushing me.

I don't see how I can keep going. I've been thinking a lot about just ending it all, maybe then I wouldn't be a burden to anyone anymore. It feels like the only way out of this feeling.
