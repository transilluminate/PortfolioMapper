I was recently asked to support the acute inpatient ward with a case involving 'Tom', a young man with a mild learning disability who was admitted during a mental health crisis. Tom was presenting with extreme anxiety and behaviour that the team found challenging, and he was not engaging with the standard ward routine. The staff felt unequipped to manage his needs, and there was a risk of his distress being seen simply as a component of his learning disability, a classic case of diagnostic overshadowing.

My initial focus was to conduct a comprehensive assessment that accounted for both his acute mental state and his communication needs. I worked alongside the ward team to introduce reasonable adjustments, such as using an easy-read daily planner and a communication passport that we co-developed with Tom's family. This immediately helped reduce his anxiety by making the environment more predictable. I also spent time with the ward nurses, modelling how to adapt their communication and explaining how Tom's anxiety was a separate clinical issue, which required a different approach to his baseline needs.

Following this intervention, Tom's engagement improved significantly, and the ward staff reported feeling more confident in their ability to provide him with appropriate care. The experience highlighted a clear systems-level gap in knowledge. As a result, I am now collaborating with the trust's Learning Disability liaison team to develop a basic 'crisis pack' for ward admissions. This will include templates for communication passports and guidance on making reasonable adjustments, ensuring we provide equitable and effective care for all patients, bridging the gap between mental health and learning disability services.
