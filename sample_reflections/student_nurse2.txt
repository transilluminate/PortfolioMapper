This afternoon I had the opportunity to administer a scheduled medication to Mrs. D under the direct supervision of my practice assessor. The prescription was for Furosemide 40mg, to be given orally at 14:00.

My first step was to apply the 'five rights' of medication administration, which we've covered extensively in our clinical skills sessions. I located the medication and checked it against the prescription chart, confirming it was the right drug at the right dose. I then went to the bedside with my assessor, where I confirmed Mrs. D's identity using her name and date of birth against her wristband (right patient). I checked the chart again to confirm it was the right time and the right route (oral).

When I offered Mrs. D the tablet, she mentioned that she sometimes has difficulty swallowing and asked if she could have it with a thickening agent she uses for her drinks. I recalled from a pharmacology lecture that changing the fluid a medication is taken with could potentially affect its absorption. I explained to Mrs. D that I needed to check if that was safe first. My assessor and I quickly consulted the British National Formulary (BNF), which didn't contraindicate it, so we proceeded.

This was a valuable experience because it wasn't just a simple task. I had to connect my theoretical knowledge about pharmacokinetics with a real-world patient concern. By pausing to check the BNF, I feel I was acting in the patient's best interest and ensuring safe practice (NMC Code 6.1). It showed me that communicating clearly with the patient (NMC Code 7.1) can reveal important information that isn't on the chart. In the future, I will make a point of asking patients about their swallowing or preferences as a routine part of my medication administration check.
