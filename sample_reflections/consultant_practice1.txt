For the past several quarters, our integrated care system (ICS) has identified a persistent trend of delayed transfers of care (DTOC) for frail, elderly patients admitted to our acute medical unit (AMU). While we have multiple discharge pathways, they seem to operate as a series of disjointed, reactive handoffs rather than a cohesive, patient-centred process. This was starkly illustrated by the case of Mrs. Patient, an 89-year-old with multiple comorbidities whose discharge was delayed by 11 days due to a failure to coordinate a complex package of care with community and social services.

My initial involvement was clinical, but it became immediately apparent that Mrs. P's case was not an outlier but a symptom of a systemic failure. My actions, therefore, shifted from case management to system analysis. I initiated a multi-agency root cause analysis, bringing together stakeholders from the AMU, social services, community nursing, and commissioning. This aligns with my role in leading peer reviews and evaluating health outcomes from a systems perspective.

Our analysis revealed that the existing evidence base and national guidelines for discharge planning are predicated on a linear, predictable patient journey. This model fundamentally breaks down for patients like Mrs. P, whose needs are complex and non-linear. The system is designed to ask "Is the patient medically fit?" before triggering a separate, often delayed, social and community assessment. This is a flawed paradigm.

Based on this, I proposed a new conceptual model: "Concurrent, Integrated Discharge Planning." This model challenges the assumption that medical and social needs can be assessed sequentially. I developed and led a pilot project on the AMU where a senior community matron was embedded into the daily board rounds. Their role was not to receive a referral, but to co-produce the daily management plan from day one of admission, anticipating and resolving community-based barriers to discharge in parallel with acute medical treatment.

This intervention required me to lead significant change and manage risk in an unpredictable environment. I had to negotiate new ways of working across organisational boundaries and challenge long-held professional identities. The pilot data, collected over three months, was compelling: a 40% reduction in DTOC for this cohort and a significant improvement in patient and staff satisfaction.

This experience has generated a novel insight: the point of highest leverage for improving flow for frail patients is not at the point of discharge, but at the point of admission. By embedding community expertise at the "front door" of the acute hospital, we transform the system from reactive to proactive. I have since presented these findings and the new model at the ICS executive board, leading to the commissioning of a system-wide rollout. This work, which contributes to a new, evidence-based model of care, demonstrates leadership in research and innovation that generates new knowledge for the system.
