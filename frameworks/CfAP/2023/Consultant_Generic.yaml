  - "Purpose: Help firmly establish values-based professional practice across pathways, services, organisations and systems, working with individuals, families, carers, communities and others."

  - "('Values-based' practice with service users, the public, staff and students upholds the values of compassionate, respectful, person-centred, safe, evidence-based and integrated care, relationships, and services that challenge stigma, are inclusive, work together and use limited public money carefully. 'Others' includes all partners involved in contributing to services across the system.)"
